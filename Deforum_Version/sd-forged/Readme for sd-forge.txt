To get DeforumationQT to run with Forge, install the original https://github.com/deforum-art/sd-forge-deforum 

For windows users that want to use the piped version, copy the three files from "sd-forge-deforum-piped" into
the sd-forge-deforum/scripts/helpers folder, replacing render.py and animation.py

For Linux users, that need to run the websocket version, copy the three files from "sd-forge-deforum-websocket" into
the sd-forge-deforum/scripts/helpers folder, replacing render.py and animation.py

That's it!
